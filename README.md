# FurnitureMain 
*A prototype application for the Real Office Furniture Company (ROFC).  The application will allow ROFC staff to record details of individual orders.*

The company offers furniture in oak or walnut. The prices are based on the number of units (cubic centimetres) of wood required for each item The current charge/price of each unit is 4p for oak and 3p for walnut.

# The prototype support the following furniture items:
# Chairs:
Only one chair style is available and it can come with optional armrests. A standard chair uses 1625 units of wood and if the customer chooses armrests, it takes another 250 units.

# Tables:
A single circular table is available and it can come with a wooden or chrome base. The customer can request any size (diameter) that is 50 centimeters or more. ROFC assumes the table is square for the purpose of calculating the number of units of wood. The following information is required to calculate the item price of the table: Wooden base price: £45.00 Chrome base price: £35.00 Number of units formula: diameter x diameter Total table price is: (number of units * charge) + price of the base

# Desks: Customers can request desks with 1-4 draws and the total item price can be calculated using the following formula:
(((height + width + depth) * 12) + (depth * width) * price per unit) + (number of draws * £8.50) Note: The height of all desks is 80cm
